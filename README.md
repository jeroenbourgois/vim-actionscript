This is a simple mirror from the excellent actionscript.vim file made by (http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/vim-actionscript-and-mxml-syntax-files/)Abdul Qabiz !

You can just clone the repo inside your /VIMFOLDER/bundle and then load everything up with pathogen.

To bad :( but you can always create an issue :)
