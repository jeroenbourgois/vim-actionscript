vim-actionscript
================
This is a simple mirror from the excellent actionscript.vim file made by [Abdul Qabiz](http://www.abdulqabiz.com/blog/archives/2007/10/12/vim-actionscript-and-mxml-syntax-files/)!

Usage
-----
You can just clone the repo inside your /VIMFOLDER/bundle and then load everything up with pathogen.

Problems?
---------
To bad :( but you can always create an issue :)
